# Jetpack Compose workshop

This repo contains the slides and examples of my Jetpack Compose workshop. So far, the workshop has been presented during

- Rheinwerk KKON 2022

To use the examples, do **not** open the base directory of the repository in Android Studio. All examples are separate projects, so, to use an example open the base directory of the example. For example, to look at *CounterDemoCompose* open *path-to-repo/examples/CounterDemoCompose*.

*License*

All slides and examples are published under the terms of the MIT license.
